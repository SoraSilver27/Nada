<h1>Never gonna give you up</h1>
<h2>Rick Astley</h2>
<p>
We're no strangers to love <br>
You know the rules and so do I (do I) <br>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of <br>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy <br>
</p>
<p>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling <br>
Gotta make you understand <br>
</p>
<p>
Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
</p>
<p>
We've known each other for so long <br>
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it) <br>
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) <br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it <br>
</p>
<p>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling <br>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see <br> 
</p>
<p>
Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
